Once authenticated, users are implicitly trusted for the duration of the session. This assumption no longer holds in modern enterprise environments where threats such as session hijacking, credential theft, insider misuse, and malware-driven account takeover are increasingly common.","sidebar":"sidebar"},"technical-papers/continuous-authentication/03 system-architecture":{"id":"technical-papers/continuous-authentication/03 system-architecture","title":"System Architecture","description":"The proposed continuous authentication system is designed as a modular, multimodal architecture that continuously evaluates user identity during an active session.
